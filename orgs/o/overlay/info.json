Users can take long or short positions with leverage on the value of a data stream. This requires locking up a native ERC 20 token, OVL, in the stream\u2019s market contract. Overlay aims to create a self-reliant protocol that offers all participants (traders, liquidity providers, and governance participants) an opportunity to grow with Overlay through aligned incentives. If Overlay achieves its end goal, DeFi users will be able to turn any manipulation-resistant data stream into a financial instrument."}

OutDID provides a fully private ID verification tool, limiting data liabilities on the side of online apps & services, while giving their users a peace of mind knowing that their private information is safe. OutDID resolves the privacy vs verifiability dilemma by leveraging Zero Knowledge Proofs to verify original government-issued documents, without involving intermediaries who would do that verification and issue attestations. This allows Web3 and Web2 platforms alike perform identity verification in a fully private and trustless manner."}

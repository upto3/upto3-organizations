The game blends mechanics from massively multiplayer online role playing games(MMORPGs) and Web3-enabled virtual worlds. An Otherdeed NFT represents more than a simple picture of land, it\u2019s an access token to participate in playtesting and co-creation of Otherside. Additionally, each Otherdeed NFT depicts a plot of land that will be available in Otherside (aka a Plot), with a unique composition of natural elements, resources, elemental attributes, and more."}

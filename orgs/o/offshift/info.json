On Offshift , users burn XFT to mint on-chain synthetics called anonAssets via a tokenomic process called Shifting. Shifting dissociates users from their XFT, and thereby renders users anonymous with respect to their freshly minted anonAssets. As standard, public ERC20 tokens, anonAssets introduce no novel barriers to feature implementation or platform integration in the Ethereum ecosystem, and therefore eliminate yield-related tradeoffs associated with privacy."}

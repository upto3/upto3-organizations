The OpenEden TBILL Vault is a liquid on-chain pool that brings real-world assets into Web3, allowing holders of stablecoins to enjoy sustainable yields. As the first smart contract vault made for U.S. Treasury Bills (\u201cT-Bills\u201d), the OpenEden TBILL Vault provides investors with direct exposure to a pool of short-dated T-Bills via OpenEden\u2019s TBILL token, which is backed 1:1 by the T-Bills as well as USD Coin (\u201cUSDC\u201d) and U.S. dollar (\u201cUSD\u201d) reserves. TBILL investors will receive a return on their capital that reflects the returns provided by the underlying T-Bills held in a bankruptcy-remote special purpose vehicle. "}

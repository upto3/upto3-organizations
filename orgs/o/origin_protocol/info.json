Origin\u2019s flagship products are NFT platform Origin Story and Origin Dollar (OUSD).\nOrigin Story is here creators sell their NFTs. Creators will be able to create Origin accounts, upload audio and visual assets for their NFTs and customized websites, and schedule NFT sales using a variety of different sale formas (e.g. 1 of 1 auctions, leaderboard auctions, open editions, limited editions, and more). Origin Story will democratize NFT creation and sales.\nAt the beginning of its creation, Origin's goal was to create a shared economy marketplace that offer buyers and sellers control over their data, drastically reduced transaction fees, but after years of exploration, Origin changed the goal."}

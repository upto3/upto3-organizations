OAK Network's mission is to build a Stripe for Web 3.0 across protocols. The blockchain is built on Parity Substrate with an event-driven execution model. Differing from Ethereum\u2019s transaction-based model, where a transaction requires private key signing, OAK allows transactions to be triggered by event signals such as time, price, and smart contract state changes."}

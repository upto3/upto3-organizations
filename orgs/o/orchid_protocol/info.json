Orchid aggregates the services of numerous high-quality VPN providers in a unique, decentralized marketplace powered by OXT tokens. Bandwidth providers register as sellers on the network by staking their own capital up-front in the form of OXT. This staked capital functions like a security deposit, incentivizing VPN bandwidth providers to supply users with high-quality service. Providers who fail to do so are putting their own capital at risk."}

Any token with a liquidity pool on dAMM, market makers and investors can borrow on dAMM to provide liquidity and trade across all centralized and decentralized trading venues. Token suppliers and market makers interact directly with the dAMM protocol to both supply and borrow token liquidity without exorbitant fees, strenuous onboarding procedures and bilateral deal negotiation."}

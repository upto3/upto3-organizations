DOJO yield NFT (yNFT) model will allow the user to interact in a simplified, straightforward way with crypto ecosystems. Starting off with the yNFT generator, a mechanism where users will be able to choose NFT and DeFi assets (pre-defined by DeFi DOJO) to create a smart contract that will bind these tokens together, creating a yield yNFT with auto-compounding features."}

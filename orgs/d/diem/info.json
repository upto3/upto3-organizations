The Diem payment system incorporates three aspects that work together to create a more inclusive financial system: 1) A secure, scalable, and reliable blockchain as the technological backbone of the payment system; 2) Diem Coins that are backed by a reserve of assets made up of cash or cash equivalents and very short-term government securities; and 3) Governance by the independent Diem Association and its subsidiary Diem Networks, tasked with developing and operating the payment system."}

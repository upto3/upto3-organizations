DXdao was spawned in May 2019 through a collaboration between Gnosis and DAOstack. Reputation (REP) is voting power in DXdao, and DXD is the financial token with a claim on profit from DXdao products. Some of DXdao\u2019s products include Omen (permissionless prediction markets), Swapr (governance-enabled AMM), Carrot (programmable incentives), Mesa (batch auction DEX), DXvote (DAO governance). DXdao believes in governance and decentralization."}

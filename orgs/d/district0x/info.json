Districts provide the core functionalities required to operate an online market or community. Namely, the ability for users to post listings, filter and search through listings, rank peers and amass reputation, and send invoices and collect payments. The platform also features an ERC-20 token, DNT, that owners can use to access and even help govern (through a stake-weighted voting mechanism) specific communities."}

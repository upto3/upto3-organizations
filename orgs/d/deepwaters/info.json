To optimize speed without sacrificing trust, Deepwaters employs a rollup strategy on multiple Deepwaters-supported blockchains simultaneously. Transactions get matched off-chain, achieve consensus within the Deepwaters network, and are ultimately settled on their respective origin blockchains in batch. It secure trades with order flow encryption that prevents MEV, front-running, and any privileged counterparties from having an unfair advantage. No one can see your trades nor act on them (including Deepwaters itself) until they hit the public order book."}

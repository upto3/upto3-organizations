In early 2019, Binance launched Binance Chain. By 2020, the community utilized source code from the Ethereum network and launched a modified EVM-compatible blockchain called Binance Smart Chain. In February 2022, both the Binance Chain (rebranded as BNB Beacon Chain) and the Binance Smart Chain (rebranded as BNB Smart Chain) evolved into a unified, modular system referred to as BNB Chain. When the two blockchains merged, the Beacon Chain became the dedicated layer used for Governance (staking & voting), and the BNB Smart Chain became the dedicated layer for EVM consensus and execution."}

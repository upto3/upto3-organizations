Token holders (voters) can deposit their governance tokens into Bribe pools with proposals of their choice. Bidders are then able to bid, in an auction-style process, for access to the aggregate governance power staked in these pools. \nIn essence, voters are paid to participate in governance, and incentivized stakeholders are able to access voting power to help protect the efficacy of the protocols. Bribe places an economic value on different protocol proposals and effectively creates markets for dGov proposals.\nBribe Protocol was incubated by Composable Labs and Advanced Blockchain AG."}

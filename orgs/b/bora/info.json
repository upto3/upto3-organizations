Bora aims to attract games and applications from the GameFi sector to its Bora Chain to avoid building on blockchains like Ethereum that have high gas fees. For that reason, Bora follows a two-tiered blockchain system: the BORA token is traded on the Klaytn blockchain. The Bora chain is a modular blockchain that can be used as an execution layer by decentralized applications.\nIn 2020, South Korea top game publisher and service provider KaKao Games became the major share holding company of\u00a0Bora development company way2bit Inc. by acquiring additional stocks up to 48.5% of Way2Bit Inc."}

{"name": "Bond Protocol", "token": "OHM", "intro": "A platform for DeFi protocols to acquire their own liquidity", "links": [{"title": "Website", "url": "https://pro.olympusdao.finance/"}], "introduce": "Bond Protocol is the new industry-standard platform to help protocols acquire their own liquidity. Protocols no longer need to pay out high incentives to rent liquidity, while also guaranteeing the permanence of liquidity to facilitate transactions.\u00a0Instead of staking their LP (liquidity provider) tokens for farming rewards in a pool 2, users can exchange their LP tokens for the protocol's governance tokens at a discounted rate. This is done through a process called Bonding. As the protocol never sells these LP tokens, the liquidity is effectively locked within its treasury."}

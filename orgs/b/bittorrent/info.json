BitTorrent launched in 2001 and, despite not being blockchain-based, has long been a pioneer in decentralized technology due to its peer-to-peer architecture. BitTorrent Inc. was formed in 2004 to manage the ongoing development of the protocol and in 2018 it was acquired by Justin Sun, founder of Tron.\nIn February 2019, BitTorrent released a dedicated native token BTT, to help expand its protocol and incentivize the network\u2019s participants. In December 2021, BitTorrent announced the launch of BitTorrent Chain which is a heterogeneous cross-chain interoperability protocol, which adopts PoS and leverages sidechains for the scaling of smart contracts."}

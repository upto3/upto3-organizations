Transactions are verified by network\u00a0nodes\u00a0through\u00a0cryptography\u00a0and recorded in a public\u00a0distributed ledger\u00a0called a\u00a0blockchain. The\u00a0cryptocurrency\u00a0was invented in 2008 by an unknown person or group of people using the name\u00a0Satoshi Nakamoto. The currency began use in 2009 when its implementation was released as\u00a0open-source software."}

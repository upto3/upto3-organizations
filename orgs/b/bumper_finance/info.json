Users of protection set a floor price, and if the market crashes, their asset will never fall below that price. Importantly, if the market pumps, their asset rises too. Protected positions incur an incremental, floating premium based on asset price movements. This in turn is used to incentivise the complementary side of the market wherein stablecoin depositors may supply stablecoin into a liquidity reserve and earn a yield."}

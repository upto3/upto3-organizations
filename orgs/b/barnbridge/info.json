Its applications allow users to select from opposing pools, referred to as tranches, and take positions on risk factors like interest rates or asset prices. Its first application, SMART Yield, offers fixed and levered variable yields on stablecoins deposited into underlying lending markets like Aave, Compound, and C.R.E.A.M. Finance. Its second application, SMART Exposure, automates user position management between any two ERC-20 assets at set ratios."}

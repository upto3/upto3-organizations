It is a set of high-performance, highly interoperable, and highly secure cross-chain underlying platforms. BOOL Network could be used as a transfer bridge, an external system of Polkadot, or as the foundation for extending Polkadot's ecosystem. Furthermore, it can also run completely independent, becoming an open source public chain that can support cross-chain."}

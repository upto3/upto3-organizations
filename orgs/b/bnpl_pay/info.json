BNPL Pay tackles the counterparty risk associated with uncollateralized borrowing through a distributed network of Banking Nodes. BNPL Pay's system delegates the tasks of credit checks, risk assessment and other due diligence requirements to pool operators, and creates a set of incentive structures that reward and punish these operators for performing such tasks effectively."}

The BENQI Protocol consists of BENQI Liquidity Market (BLM) and BENQI Liquid Staking (BLS). The BENQI Liquidity Market (BLM) protocol enables users to effortlessly lend, borrow, and earn interest with their digital assets. Depositors providing liquidity to the protocol earn yield, while borrowers are able to borrow in an over-collateralized manner.The BENQI Liquid Staking (BLS) protocol is a liquid staking solution that tokenizes staked AVAX to grant users the ability to utilize the yield-bearing asset within Decentralized Finance applications."}

{"name": "Basis", "token": null, "intro": "Stable cryptocurrency protocol", "links": [{"title": "Website", "url": "https://www.basis.io/"}, {"title": "Twitter", "url": "basisprotocol"}], "introduce": "Basis is a stable cryptocurrency protocol with an algorithmic central bank designed to remove volatility. Basis is designed to keep prices stable by algorithmically adjusting supply similarly to the way central banks buy and sell fiscal debt to stabilize purchasing power. \nWhen demand is rising, the blockchain will create more Basis. The expanded supply is designed to bring the Basis price back down. When demand is falling, the blockchain will buy back Basis. The contracted supply is designed to restore Basis price.\nAfter intervention by the U.S. SEC, Basis was shut down in December of 2018."}

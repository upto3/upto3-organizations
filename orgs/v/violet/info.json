The core of the system are standardized methods to issue compliance credentials (in the form of non-transferable tokens) and map smart-contract access controls on the Ethereum network. This is paired with resilient authentication (proof of identity) and enables DeFi markets to create permissioned environments where only credential holders, who are part of continuous AML checks can gain access."}

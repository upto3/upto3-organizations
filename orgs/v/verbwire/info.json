With a few lines of code developers can seamlessly deploy and manage NFTs across multiple chains simultaneously. We are also the first API platform that supports a seamless transfer of NFTs across blockchains via Omnichain smart contracts. This is all behind an easy REST interface, meaning anyone can leverage NFTs in their projects without any knowledge of solidity or the inner workings of smart contracts or blockchains."}

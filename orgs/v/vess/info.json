C-Voxel) is the Self-Sovereign Work Credentials Protocol built on top of Ceramic Network, a decentralized data network protocol. Users can own and manage all of their work data(called \"work credential\") by attaching them to their DIDs and carry them around without being restricted to a specific platform, organization, or blockchain. \nEach work data is visualized as a colorful VOXEL, which is a 3D cube with a different appearance and color depending on the type of achievement (e.g., job title, rewards, deliverables, etc.). As these Voxels accumulate, the user's experiences and achievements are gathered like particles to form the user's unique identity."}

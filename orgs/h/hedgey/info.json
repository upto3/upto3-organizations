It has worked with treasuries such as Gnosis, Shapeshift, DAOHaus, and more to create the core tooling DAOs use to prosper. Hedgey's products are aimed at streamlining token operations for treasuries, such as executing DAO-to-DAO token swaps, locked token sales and distributions with investors, and locked token compensation for employees and contributors.

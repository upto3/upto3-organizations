It is a innovative solution to the KYC problem in DeFi for both individuals and services (B2C & B2B). Hashbon Pass\u2019 key feature is anonymous KYC. This means that DeFi-protocols do not actually have access to the user s personal data, but they can filter out individuals from sanction lists, as well as calculate the user\u2019s credit scoring and social rating."}

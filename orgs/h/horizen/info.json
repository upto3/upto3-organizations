The platform enables businesses and developers to create their own public or private blockchains and decentralized applications on its distributed network.\nThe project uses a verifiable cross-chain transfer protocol called Zendoo as its sidechain solution. The project also features a zero-knowledge proof protocol (zk-SNARK) to ensure secure communications with the sidechains."}

It provides a way to ask questions that machines cannot answer without human help. For example, when an AI learns how to suggest shoes, it first needs to know which shoes people think are similar. HUMAN lets you ask the question, provide the data, and pay people who help. Companies building services like product search gain new options to create the datasets that power artificial intelligence.\nThe Protocol enables automated job markets where humans work on interesting jobs and repetitive tasks are handled by machines. Network participants use HMT to pay for labor via smart bounties and reward validators who provide services to the network."}

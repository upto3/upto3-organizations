Using a hybrid consensus mechanism, the Cypherium blockchain is designed to achieve commercial viability while preserving the characteristics of decentralization and distributed ledger technology (DLT).\nCypherium's approach to creating financial inclusion between civilians, banks, government, and enterprises begins with Digital Currency Interoperability Framework (DCIF). The DCIF is Cypherium's proprietary architecture for allowing any asset, including Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), stable coins, and digital assets, to be received or distributed on-chain or cross-ledger. Furthermore, it can be integrated with payment service providers, banks, and digital wallets."}

The protocol creates a structured workflow that combines perpetuals and debt strategies to make the hedging mechanism completely self-sufficient and inexpensive.\u00a0Price pegged wrapped tokens called crTOKENs (ex - crETH for ETH) are minted for staked assets that have a dynamic price floor enforcing protection."}

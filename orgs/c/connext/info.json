Developers can use Connext to build crosschain applications. Connext is the leading protocol for fast, fully noncustodial transfers and contract calls between EVM-compatible chains. Anyone can use Connext to send transactions of value or calldata across chains and rollups. Yet, unlike the majority of other interoperability systems, Connext enables these abilities without introducing any new trust assumptions or external validators. Through the use of cross-chain focused liquidity providers called routers, Connext is able to facilitate cross-chain swaps and relay calldata across chains without a hitch."}

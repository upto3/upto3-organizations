Credix is working directly with local borrowers such as FinTechs lenders to provide them capital at an attractive interest rate, so they can use these funds for lending purposes. Investors can get access to these securitized and high-yield opportunities via the platform. Accredited investors (hedge funds, private equity, etc.) can invest in credit deals directly, or can spread their risk by investing in liquidity pools which diversifies across deals."}

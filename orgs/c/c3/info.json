With C3, users can trade cryptocurrencies on a world-class platform, knowing that they have full control over how they custody their funds without having to rely on the exchange to hold and secure them. Individuals can seamlessly trade from a wide range of non-custodial wallets covering multiple blockchains, while institutions can do so through their preferred custodian."}

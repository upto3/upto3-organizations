Conflux\u2019s Tree-Graph structure can confirm multiple blocks concurrently. This parallel processing of blocks and transactions, lowers confirmation times, and substantially increases transaction throughput.\nAs a regulatory compliant, public, and permissionless blockchain in China, Conflux is building a borderless transactional and technological ecosystem for globally-minded crypto projects, extending beyond China to North America, Russia, Latin America, Europe, Africa, and the rest of the world."}

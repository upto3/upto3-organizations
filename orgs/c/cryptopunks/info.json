The experimental project was inspired by the London punk scenes, the cyberpunk movement. The Cryptopunks are one of the earliest examples of a \"Non-Fungible Token\" on Ethereum, and were inspiration for the ERC-721 standard that powers most digital art and collectibles. The project was launched in June 2017 by the Larva Labs studio."}

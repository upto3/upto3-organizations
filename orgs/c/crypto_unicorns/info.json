Its gameplay centers around Unicorn and Land NFTs, which players utilize in a fun farming simulation, and other activities including Unicorn Jousting, Racing, and Team Battling.\nThe game implements a dual token structure and has a governance token, RBW (Rainbow Token), and a breeding token, UNIM (Unicorn Milk). Holders of the RBW token can utilize these tokens for Unicorn Evolution and Breeding, Staking to vote on key governance decisions and Treasury management, ultimately decentralizing the game economy."}

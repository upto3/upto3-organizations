Its first offering allows teams to scale their applications 100-fold by allowing them to spin up a production-grade rollup, built on the OP Stack, in a fraction of the time. App-specific rollups on Conduit are launched, maintained, and scaled by infrastructure professionals so that teams can focus on what\u2019s most important: building products that users love. DeFi protocols, gaming companies, NFT platforms, and other on-chain providers can use Conduit to quickly and easily scale their applications, offering a better user experience and unlocking new use cases previously made impossible by network congestion.

We\u2019ve developed an innovative tool for creators to build multi-media content tours called Trails with attached community audio spaces, then mint and sell their Trails as NFT access tokens to effectively monetize content value and engage their audiences.Campground is powered by Emoji Protocol and $EMOJI token, an underlying token system that gamifies reactions in an \u201cemotion prediction market\u201d and decentralizes content quality validation through an Expert review network. Emoji is designed to eventually expand as an interoperable layer and plug into all content/media platforms generally as a powerful user engagement lever."}

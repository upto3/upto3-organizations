Chain is powered by Sequence.\nSequence is a ledger-as-a-service for managing balances. It combines the power of a token-based data model with the convenience of the cloud, making it easy to build, operate, and scale forward-thinking products. Sequence is used as a system of record by a diverse set of companies including mobile wallets, crypto asset exchanges, lending platforms, asset managers, and many more. Any application that needs to record transactions and calculate balances can benefit from using Sequence.\nFounded in 2014, Chain has raised over $40 million in funding from Kholsa Ventures, Pantera Capital, Capital One, and Visa. In 2018, Chain was acquired by Stellar to form Interstellar, a commercial arm to the Stellar Foundation. In 2020, Chain was re-acquired to continue its mission."}

By leveraging cross-chain message passing and smartly aggregating multi-chain liquidity sources from top DEXes and bridges, ChainHop enables one-click, cross-chain swaps with the deepest liquidity and the best rate. Additionally, ChainHop is highly composable with other dApps allowing developers to easily access the cross-chain liquidity protocol in order to build cross-chain DeFi, NFT marketplaces, IDO launchpad platforms, and more.

Cortex Virtual Machine (CVM) is a framework that allows efficient machine learning inference on the Cortex blockchain. It enables the integration of machine learning models into smart contracts and dApps. Cortex has put forth a mechanism that incentivizes AI developers to store models on the blockchain. This creates an open ecosystem where individual AI developers are incentivized to upload their AI models to the blockchain, and Dapp developers have access to choose from the best AI models in the world."}

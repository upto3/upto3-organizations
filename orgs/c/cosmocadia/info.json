Players work together to turn the overgrown wilderness into an utopia. This can be done in the community-shared land or in privately-owned land. During gameplay, players can forage and farm to gather resources. These resources can then be used to cook food or craft furniture that in turn is used to decorate the land. Resources, cooked food, and crafted items can be sold to the in-game shop for $CADIA or sold on the player-to-player marketplace."}

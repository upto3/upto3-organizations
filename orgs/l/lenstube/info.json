Creators can upload their content to Arweave, and the data will be permanently stored on Polygon. With low gas fees, users can publish and monetize their video content. Additionally, viewers can support users by minting their favorite content and tips, using memberships to join channels, and more. Lenstube's goal is to develop a decentralized video sharing application that allows content creators to own their video content and always monetize their content through various means such as NFT modules."}

While Loopring technology is usable across DEXs as a protocol layer, the platform also delivers Loopring Exchange, a non-custodial trading platform that offers secure, high-speed trades with no gas fees.\n\nLoopring leverages Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) \u2014 a blockchain innovation that bundles transactions together for efficiency \u2014 to allow anyone to build a high-throughput, non-custodial DEX. Loopring also uses its native LCR token to reward Zero-Knowledge Rollup (zk-Rollup) operators and liquidity providers."}

The recipients can withdraw these funds at any time. This eliminates the need for manual transactions. When used by employers to pay employees, employers will be able to deposit funds and create streams for employees. The employee starts getting paid the second that stream is created and can withdraw at any time.\u00a0LlamaPay is built by\u00a0DefiLlama."}

To solve the low liquidity issue of the NFT market, the Litra protocol will turn an NFT into a standard asset and increase its price precision by locking the NFT in the protocol and minting the corresponding wrapped NFT (ERC-20). With the features of auto-concentrated liquidity and customised bonding curves, not only is the impermanent loss reduced for liquidity providers, but traders also benefit from exceptionally low slippage."}

The player is tasked with navigating Owlie through pairs of pipes that have gaps placed at random heights. Owlie automatically descends and only ascends when the player taps the touchscreen. Each successful pass through a pair of pipes awards the player one point and each successful collection of ether awards the player ten points."}

The solution is based on a points system that creators set within each NFT to encourage user interaction. These interactions are made between the NFT holders and the platforms Fragsy has integrated (currently Twitter, Spotify and the custom Fragsy API). The more the NFT holder interacts, the more the NFT will upgrade its appearance, attributes and utilities."}

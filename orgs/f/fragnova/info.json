Fragnova was born with the vision to enable a decentralized gaming ecosystem that allows anyone to develop and play games, interlink experiences, platforms and users. To create an environment that provides ownership rights to its users and the right tools to establish new forms of monetization, independent of closed systems, for its creators."}

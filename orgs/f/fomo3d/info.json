{"name": "Fomo3D", "token": null, "intro": "Lottery game", "links": [], "introduce": "Fomo3D is a lottery game in which the grand prize winner is the last person to purchase a key \u2014 a lottery ticket \u2014 using ETH[2] (a crypto) before the countdown timer runs down to zero. During a round, a timer is constantly counting down to zero. Every time a key is purchased, the buyer becomes the new \u201cholder of the private keys\u201d and additional time is added to the countdown. The price of the keys will get slightly more expensive with each purchase. When the timer reaches zero, the last person to have bought a key wins the round. At the end of the round, the ETH in the pot (the reward pool) is divvied up."}

Someone with crypto can create a TipLink and send that link to anyone over any platform (text, discord, email, etc). Once a user has connected their wallet to TipLink, they can deposit funds and then transfer ownership by sharing a link. Each transaction creates a new wallet, too, so the recipient needn't download a new browser extension or app to use the money. And, if the recipient doesn\u2019t claim the funds, the sender can still reclaim them."}

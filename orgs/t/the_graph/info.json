Anyone can build and publish open APIs, called subgraphs, making data easily accessible.\nThe Graph analyzes and gathers blockchain data before storing it into various indices, called Subgraphs, allowing any application to send a query to its protocol and receive an immediate response.\nThe Graph\u2019s native cryptocurrency, GRT, is used to ensure the integrity of the data secured within its network. Any user, whether they are indexers, curators or delegators, must stake GRT to perform their roles, and, in return, earn fees from the network."}

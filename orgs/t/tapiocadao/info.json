The core products feature Singularity, an isolated risk borrow and lending market (based off of Sushiswap's Kashi product), and Yield Box (BentoBox V2), a permissionless token vault. It will also offer the ability to mint 'usd0' which is a decentralized overcollateralized omnichain stablecoin. Tapioca will utilize LayerZero's technology to enable cross chain composability without the need for bridging."}

Threshold is made up of two networks (NuCypher and Keep) in a similar space that have decided to launch the first ever on-chain merger of two decentralized networks that share a common goal. That goal is to safeguard the users sovereignty on public blockchain networks through the use of Threshold cryptography. Keep networks infrastructure and NuCypher\u2019s privacy capabilities will allow users to keep their digital assets private and secure."}

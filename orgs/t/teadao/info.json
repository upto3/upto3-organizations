TeaDAO allows GameFi projects to create an NFT Liquidity Pool by providing liquidity (stablecoins) into the TeaDAO treasury. These stables are used to mint TEA. Their users then are able to sell NFTs into the pool and receive TEA (which is backed by stables that the GameFi projects have poured into the treasury) in return. Once NFTs are sold into the pool, NFTs are under GameFi projects' control."}

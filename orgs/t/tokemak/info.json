It can be thought of as a decentralized market making platform and a liquidity router that disaggregates traditional liquidity provision and market making for DeFi. Sitting a \"layer above\" decentralized exchanges, Tokemak allows for control over where the liquidity flows, and also offers an easier, cheaper way for providing and sourcing liquidity."}

The DAO aims to use the ETH it controls to support projects that will provide a return on investment or benefit to the DAO and its members and benefit the decentralised ecosystem as a whole. The DAO launched on 30th April, 2016, and by the end of the funding period, The DAO has raised over $150m from more than 11,000 enthusiastic members, it became one of the largest crowdfunding campaigns in history.\nOn June 17, 2016, a hacker found a loophole in the coding that allowed him to drain funds from The DAO. In the attack, 3.6 million ETH were stolen, the equivalent of $70 million at the time. The Ethereum community controversially decided to hard-fork the Ethereum blockchain to restore approximately all funds to the original contract. This split the Ethereum blockchain into two branches, each with its own cryptocurrency, where the original unforked blockchain continued as Ethereum Classic."}

Unlike Uniswap, where assets can be swapped in real time, borrowing on Timeswap involves swapping tokens until repayment is completed. Lenders provide Asset A for borrowing, while \u2018protecting\u2019 a certain amount of Asset B that borrowers use as collateral. Users can tailor their risk profiles to have higher interest rates at lower collateral ratios and vice versa."}

Every project listed on Treasure\u2019s marketplace utilizes MAGIC in their respective metaverses, with each community inventing its own lore and storytelling for this resource. MAGIC, the native token of Treasure, is the sole currency for marketplace transactions. In this way, MAGIC acts as the reserve currency for the entire web of metaverses connected under the Treasure umbrella. Treasure projects are linked\u2013narratively and economically\u2013through MAGIC. The DAO uses MAGIC emissions to grow new projects and continue supporting more mature ones."}

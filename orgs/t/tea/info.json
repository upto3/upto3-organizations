Miners own hardware mining machines, buy CML (NFT, similar to software licenses), provide computing services and receive TEA rewards. Investors don't have to own miners, they can invest in miners, TApps or even CML and TEA to get ROI. Developers use the TEA framework to develop TApps, run on mining machines and provide services to earn revenue, which will be distributed to investors and miners based on smart contracts on the bonding curve."}

The firm launched its first product called LNQ (pronounced \"link\") in May 2022. LNQ is a chip that uses Polygon's blockchain technology to authenticate products and create \"digital twins,\" virtual copies of physical objects. LNQ allows users to have a single sign-on or ID for all the brands they are involved with, and it enables them to track provenance. On the other hand, brands can access data related to how consumers are behaving with products and unlock new revenue models."}

It supports smart contract development and introduces data privacy by default for these contracts, enabling developers to build decentralized applications that also protect user data and preserve privacy.\nThe protocol implements \"programmable privacy,\" which is defined as arbitrarily complex data privacy controls within an application. Secret Network calls these privacy-preserving applications Secret Apps. Secret Network's mainnet went live on Feb. 13, 2020,\u00a0its goal is to become the data privacy center of Web3."}

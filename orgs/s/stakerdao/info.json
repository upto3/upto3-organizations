The StakerDAO community builds and manages products for on-chain governance, cross-chain synthetics, and tokenized real-world assets. Blend (BLND) is the first basket token offered by StakerDAO, enabling holders to go in and out of a position without traditional staking lockups and may offer tax advantages versus holding the underlying PoS tokens."}

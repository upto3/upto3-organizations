The protocol allows assets of all kinds to be tokenized in a way that makes them fully compliant across jurisdictions and transferable across any ERC20 platform.\nTokens built on top of the STP-Standard will use the protocol\u2019s on-chain Compliance Validator to verify compliance with relevant regulations (i.e. KYC, AML, Accreditation, etc.) as well as any issuer-specific requirements (i.e. ownership concentration, holding periods, voting). The Validator Committee will serve an advisory function to ensure the Compliance Validator is enforcing the most up-to-date legislation at all times."}

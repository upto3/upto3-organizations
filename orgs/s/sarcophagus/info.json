The Sarcophagus protocol works by giving a person a series of actions to complete to verify they are alive. The deadman\u2019s switch is triggered if the person does not perform the actions. A user creating their \u201csarcophagus\u201d provides the Ethereum address that accesses a file when the protocol is triggered. They also include a recipient's public address and date at which to try opening the sarcophagus. Sarcophagus was incubated by Decent Labs."}

Spectral\u2019s first product is an on-chain credit score, which gives lenders an improved mechanism to evaluate borrower risk, and grants the user full control over their identity and pseudonymity on the blockchain.\nAs a fully programmable and composable financial primitive, Spectral\u2019s credit score (MACRO score) enables permissionless execution of existing financial applications such as credit delegation and securitized debt, and lays the foundation for innovative new implementations that leverage on-chain transaction history to build user creditworthiness."}

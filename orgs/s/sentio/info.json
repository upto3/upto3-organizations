Through Sentio's software development kit, users can collect metrics and event logs based on smart contracts' events, transactions, traces and states across blockchains, including Ethereum, Aptos, Polygon and Avalanche. Sentio handles the indexing process for this information, but users can then build dashboards that visualize such data. This allows them to monitor for possible breaches or issues and receive alerts for certain activities on the blockchain. "}

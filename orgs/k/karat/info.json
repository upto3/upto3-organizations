The AME starts by collecting on-chain data from the history of each wallet address. Based on the address\u2019 smart contract connection and transaction histories, AME draws out users' profiles based on-chain behavioral patterns. Projects can then use KaratDAO\u2019s smart contract generator to deploy claimable token or NFT rewards and private sales."}

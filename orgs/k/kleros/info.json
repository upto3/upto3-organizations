It acts as a decentralized third party capable of providing decisions on the correct result when applying a set of rules to questions ranging from simple to highly complex. This is achieved by using game-theoretic incentives to have crowdsourced jurors analyze and rule on cases correctly. When a dispute does occur, each party can apply for arbitration through the Kleros arbitrators that are selected from the owners of PNK tokens. The arbitration fees are distributed to all arbitrators in the form of ETH; jurors who have issued a minority decision lose part of their PNK tokens for the benefit of the majority of jurors."}

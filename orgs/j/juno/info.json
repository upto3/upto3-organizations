Anyone can create & use inter-chain applications on Juno. The ecosystem is pioneering CosmWasm development and adoption, allowing developers to deploy secure & robust inter-chain smart contracts in Rust. The Juno proof of stake blockchain is built using the Cosmos SDK and reaches network agreement via Tendermint Consensus. The network is governed by delegators, who vote in changes via on-chain governance."}

Rather than requiring liquidity providers (LPs) to provide liquidity through token pairs (e.g. ETH-AVAX), LPs can simply provide liquidity through the provision of a single token type. This mechanism aims to improve upon the existing AMM framework by mitigating impermanent loss risk for LPs, reducing slippage for traders, and creating more capital efficiency throughout the broader ecosystem."}

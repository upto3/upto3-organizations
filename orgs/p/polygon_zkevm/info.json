{"name": "Polygon zkEVM", "token": null, "intro": "Zero-knowledge scaling solution", "links": [{"title": "Website", "url": "https://polygon.technology/polygon-zkevm"}], "introduce": "Polygon zkEVM is the first zero-knowledge scaling solution that is fully equivalent to an EVM. All existing smart contracts, developer toolings and wallets work seamlessly. Polygon zkEVM harnesses the power of zero-knowledge proofs in order to reduce transaction costs and massively increase throughput, all while inheriting the security of Ethereum."}

As such, it brings traditional finance (TradFi) options trading to DeFi, and takes advantage of the significant assets and liquidity already on Uniswap v3.Panoptic works through the management of liquidity within Uniswap v3 pools. It functions as a set of smart contracts that handles the creation of long and short options through the movement of liquidity closer to, or further away from, the spot price. This is Panoptic\u2019s key innovation."}

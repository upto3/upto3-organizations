Polymer's solution allows developers to build applications that abstract the problems of \u201csiloed\u201d blockchains away from the end-users. The ultimate goal is to create a universal IBC based router and rollup protocol for intercommunication across all chains and ecosystems.\nThe Polymer solution aims to supplement the IBC protocol of Cosmos by extending its capabilities so that chains outside of the Cosmos, or IBC-based ecosystem, can easily utilize and interact with the vast ecosystem of chains that are based on IBC."}

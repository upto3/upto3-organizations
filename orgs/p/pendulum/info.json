Pendulum is built on Substrate and will allow DeFi applications to connect to the foreign exchange market and build automated market makers (AMMs) to offer scalable liquidity pools for fiat currencies and provide yield earning opportunities for fiat token holders. Pendulum aims to become a Polkadot parachain for maximum security and interoperability."}

Synthetic Potions (pTokens) are collateralized by stablecoins like BUSD, USDt, USDc, DAI, MIM, tUSD, FRAX, or ibTokens like cDAI, cUSDC, cUSDT, aDAI which when locked in the Vault Contract enable the issuance of Potions. Synthetic Potions mimic the price behavior of real-world assets like stocks, commodities, etfs and give traders anywhere in the world open access to price exposure without the implications of owning or trading real assets."}

The platform doesn\u2019t offer direct peer-to-peer lending but instead adopts a novel mechanism built around its native token. Papr is minted by borrowers, who transfer some collateral to a papr controller (a smart contract). Borrowers can then exchange their papr for other assets using a decentralized exchange (e.g. Uniswap). "}

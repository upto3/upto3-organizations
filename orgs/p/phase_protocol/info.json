Featuring a fully on-chain and decentralized process, Phase Protocol integrates directly with minting contracts and then gradually releases funds as teams complete their project development goals. Phase Protocol provides greater security for NFT holders and reduces reputational risk for launchpads stemming from poor quality projects and founders."}

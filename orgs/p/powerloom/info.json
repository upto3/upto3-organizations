It aims to build trust and offer meaningful insights on demand through a rich ecosystem of peers and stakeholders that are incentivized to participate in the protocol. PowerLoom Protocol brings decentralized accountability to popular protocols where actions and decisions are hidden behind a complex web of interactions between smart contracts and abstracted identity."}

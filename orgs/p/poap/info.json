POAPs, the collectibles, are NFTs minted under the Proof of Attendance Protocol smart contract. Each POAP is a digital record held by collectors as digital proof that they attended, or participated in, a physical, virtual, or spiritual event. Each POAP is a gift from an issuer to collectors, in celebration of a special shared memory. By minting these memories to the blockchain, collectors build a rich tapestry of tokenized experiences which unlock a world of possibilities."}

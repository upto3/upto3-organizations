Proton aims to provide a secure, verified identity account which is integrated with a financial settlements layer that allows users to directly link this identity with fiat accounts, pull funds and buy crypto, and use that crypto seamlessly in apps, all without sending any of the user\u2019s private, sensitive information. Proton was developed as a joint effort by two companies: Metal and Lynx."}

Complementary to that, Alfprotocol offers two protocols for unleveraged liquidity management: AlfMM (a decentralized exchange service) and Alf (an overcollateralized borrowing service). The core purpose of both protocols is to provide entry points for traders and risk-averse investors, offering them a platform to trade and provide liquidity, all the while reining in additional revenue from indirectly providing liquidity."}

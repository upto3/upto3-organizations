The platform consists of a developer dashboard and SDKs. Developers can configure SDK usage as per their requirements using the dashboard. Applications integrated with Arcana SDKs can provide the familiar web2 login and authentication experience for onboarding users. Application users can upload their data to the distributed Arcana Store. This data in Arcana Store is fully owned by users and not accessible to the application or developers. Users can choose to share their data with others."}

The universe of Armaldia is multiple and diversified: it is composed of 198k revenue generating land plots that can be purchased as NFT. Armaldia has two types of insolite plots and visual themes: a wild land and a tech land. The game permits to own land, construct buildings, produce resources, buy, sell and trade. But still the main attraction is an interactive structured war between two conflicting factions \u2014 Hitech and Wild Magic."}

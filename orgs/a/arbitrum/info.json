Arbitrum leverages the ability to communicate between L1 and L2, allowing any form of Ethereum asset to be transferred between Layer 1 and Layer 2 without trust.\nAlthough Arbitrum transactions are still settled on Ethereum, Arbitrum only submits the raw transaction data to Ethereum, with execution and contract storage occurring off-chain, so the gas fee required on Arbitrum is very small compared to the mainnet, and the contracts are fully compatible with no gas limit."}

At Axelar\u2019s core is a permissionless overlay network that delivers Turing-complete cross-chain communication via proof-of-stake and permissionless protocols. Sitting on top of the network are APIs and protocols, an application-development layer that developers use to compose across any number of chains. Once integrated, all new interconnected blockchains automatically become interoperable with the application, enabling limitless network effects."}

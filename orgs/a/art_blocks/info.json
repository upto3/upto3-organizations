Buyers pick a style that they like, pay for the work, and a randomly generated version of the content is created by an algorithm and sent to their Ethereum account. The resulting piece might be a static image, 3D model, or an interactive experience. Each output is different and there are endless possibilities for the types of content that can be created on the platform."}

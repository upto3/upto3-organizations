Axie infinity became popular in mid-2021 and set off a gamefi boom.\nPlayers are able to earn two tokens, Axie Infinity Shards (AXS) and Small Love Potions (SLP), by playing Axie Infinity in either Adventure or Arena modes. AXS serves as a governance token, allowing token holders to vote on the future development of the gaming experience. SLP is the in-game token used to breed Axies."}

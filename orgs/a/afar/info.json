Users will be placed in a social hub where they can chat with other players and hang out. There, a player has the option to take part in a competition that includes shooting, racing, etc. There will be four rounds, and the person with the most points at the end wins. Players can level up and receive a ton of rewards. In addition to its core gameplay, a player can also play as a landowner, a base defender similar to Clash of Clan, or a merchant flying an NFT Spaceship to the NFT Marketplace in space."}

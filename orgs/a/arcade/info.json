Anyone approved by Arcade can be a mission pool operator, including a gaming guild. Operators will be able to play games using NFTs owned by Arcade\u2019s treasury or lent to Arcade, which are then used to generate rewards.\nMission pool contributors, on the other hand, are arcade token holders who get to decide which operators and in-game activities they wish to support by depositing their xarcade tokens in a mission pool. The deposited xarcade token is locked in the mission pool and returned upon completion along with a proportionate share of the rewards."}

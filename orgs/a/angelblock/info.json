When a project lists on AngelBlock with a fundraising goal, all the money they\u2019ll be getting is locked in a smart contract, and from there, the rules apply to both investors and startups. The projects can get the funds based on a milestone-based model where they commit to delivering certain parts of the project or a time-based model."}

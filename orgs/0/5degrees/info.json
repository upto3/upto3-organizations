It can be easily implanted into any protocol layer or business layer of Web3.0. The 5Degrees protocol capitalizes the user\u2019s core data to generate NFTs. These NFTs belong to the users, which can be traded in any NFT market and can be used by any smart contract to confirm the user relationship on-chain."}

Assets are securely held by a guardian who guarantees that the asset owner\u2019s physically-backed token can be burned in exchange for the physical asset at any time. Guardians are held accountable through on-chain audits and staking pools. Assets are fully insured on-chain against damage and loss. At its core, the protocol is a coordination layer between the digital and physical worlds."}

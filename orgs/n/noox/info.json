These badges will be Soulbound NFTs that cannot be transferred. In this way, the NFTs that people own are unique identifiers, and may be used as their on-chain identity to unlock new opportunities.\nNoox's vision is to build a protocol that allows anyone to program arbitrary rules into a badge standard (e.g. # of tx, volume of tx, value of tx, type of action) and allow others to claim them if they\u2019re eligible."}

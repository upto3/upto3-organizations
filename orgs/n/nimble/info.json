Nimble's first product is digital asset and smart contract risk cover. Nimble combines the benefits of the insurance process with the technological efficiencies of blockchain technology. This technology means insureds, underwriters, actuaries, claims assessors, appraisers, and capital providers work in a decentralized environment."}

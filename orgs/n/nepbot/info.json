By connecting one\u2019s own Discord account to a Near wallet, and setting up token-gated Discord roles, community members can verify their identity and assets on Near, therefore gaining access to specific content. It enables token-gated experience for Discord communities in the NEAR ecosystem, including the Octopus Network."}

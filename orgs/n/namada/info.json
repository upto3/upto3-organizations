Namada natively interoperates with fast-finality chains via IBC and with Ethereum via a trustless two-way bridge. For privacy, Namada deploys an upgraded version of the multi-asset shielded pool (MASP) circuit that allows all assets to share a common shielded set. Namada is Anoma\u2019s first fractal instance and it deploys v1 of the Anoma protocol."}

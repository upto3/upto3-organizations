Unlike the NFT marketplaces, NFEX offers leverages and long/short trading capabilities so that users can take positions in blue chip NFTs in either direction with low entry cost. Users can short NFTs directly even if they do not have any holdings. This opens up a variety of trading strategies for NFT traders including hedging, speculation and arbitrage."}

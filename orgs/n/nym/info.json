Nym protects privacy at the network layer by encrypting and relaying user's internet traffic through a multi-layered network called a mixnet. In each layer of the mixnet, mix nodes mix user's internet traffic with that of other users, making communications private and hiding metadata (IP address, who you talk to, when and where, and more)."}

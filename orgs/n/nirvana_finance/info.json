It produces two new types of tokens: ANA, a volatile asset with a reserve-backed rising floor price. NIRV a higher-order stablecoin that employs peg delegation with diversified backing. Together, these tokens create a sustainable wealth creation engine (thanks to a rising floor price), as well as a novel class of ultra-low-risk stablecoin (thanks to diversification)."}

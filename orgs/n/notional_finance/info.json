With variable rate lending, DeFi can only serve a small segment of the crypto lending market because variable interest rates don\u2019t provide the certainty that lenders and borrowers require. Notional fixes this by creating a true market for lenders and borrowers that empowers individual investors, business owners and institutional investors."}

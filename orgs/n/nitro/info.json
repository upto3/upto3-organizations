Built for the Cosmos ecosystem, Nitro serves as the gateway between Solana and Cosmos. Nitro features Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) compatibility which enables developers to access the broader Cosmos user base and expand their applications. Nitro is the first step in making SVM a development standard in crypto like the EVM. Apps built on Nitro can leverage the Solana VM (SVM) for high performance while gaining the interoperability that is native to IBC."}

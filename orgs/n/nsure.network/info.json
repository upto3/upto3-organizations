The project borrows the idea of Lloyd\u2019s London, a market place to trade insurance risks, where premiums are determined by a Dynamic Pricing Model. Nsure implements capital mining to secure capital required to back the risks at any point of time. Nsure uses a 2-phase crowd voting mechanism to ensure every claim is handled professionally."}

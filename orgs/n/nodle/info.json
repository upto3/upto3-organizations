The Nodle Chain is the parachain that powers the Nodle Network. The Nodle Network is designed to offer a global, easy to use, decentralized communications network for IoT devices. The Nodle network stack is a software solution to monetize hardware and IoT devices.With Nodle, Network Contributors share their communications resources to enable connectivity for the network. These Contributors become part of a shared, interoperable \u201cCitizen Network,\u201d and are incentivized to scale the network through a Proof of Connectivity algorithm. This Proof of Connectivity algorithm is based on the number of base stations, network bandwidth, and geographic coverage. The Nodle Network is deployed via the addition of software running on wireless devices such as smartphones, routers, fixed base stations, drones, vehicles, and other connected devices. Through an economy of connectivity and decentralized infrastructure, the Nodle Network provides a low cost, global, scalable connectivity solution enabling many services to be built on top of the Network."}

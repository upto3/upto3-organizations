Unlock's solution is an open source NFT protocol that streamlines membership benefits for online communities by giving creators control over subscription and access to their content, without any middlemen.\nThe Unlock Protocol can be applied to publishing (paywalls), newsletters, software licenses or even the physical world, such as with transportation systems."}

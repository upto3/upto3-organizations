Umee is designed to allow a multitude of DeFi product combinations between IBC-enabled chains, and was created to solve three main issues in DeFi: Detached Yields; Concentrated Systematic Risks; and Isolated Capital. As a base layer blockchain, applications and money lego primitives can be built on top of Umee to access cross chain leverage and liquidity."}

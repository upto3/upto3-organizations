Urbit comprises two pieces of technology: Peer-to-Peer Computer Network (Urbit ID), which is a distributed identity and public key infrastructure (PKI) for general-purpose authentication; Operating System (Urbit OS), which is a virtual computing platform built from the ground up. It is completely sealed from the system it runs on, somewhat like Web Assembly (WASM) or the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)."}

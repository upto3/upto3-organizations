LiquidBox provides Programmable Liquidity as a Service (LaaS) firstly on Ethereum with Uniswap V3. iZUMi Finance then launched iZiswap on BNB Chain with the innovative Discretized-Liquidity-AMM(DL-AMM) model, which was upgraded from Uniswap V3's concentrated liquidity model to implement an AMM mechanism that supports discrete liquidity on every price tick, providing DEX users with a CEX-like trading experience to place limit orders in a non-custodial orderbook way. iZUMi has also successfully issued iZUMi Bond USD (iUSD) and iZUMi Bond, and supported Bond Farming which brings stable fixed income to on-chain investors, providing a high yield level fixed income investment product for users and combining with the TradFi product model of convertible bonds to provide iZUMi Bond investors the Option which can convert to iZi token."}

It is designed to be a foundation for next-gen decentralized applications.\nIRISnet is looking to become an infrastructure layer for end-user services and applications. A key part of that is the project IRIShub, the first blockchain on IRISnet. IRIShub is designed as an innovative solution to enable as many business scenarios (NFTs, Coinswaps) as possible."}

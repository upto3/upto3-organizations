Anchor is a money-market smart-contract protocol similar to Maker, Compound and Synthetix, but it facilitates capital efficient lending & borrowing via the issuance of synthetic tokens (eg DOLA) & or tokens deposited into Anchor (eg borrowing tokens such as ETH). The first synthetic asset issued through Anchor is DOLA, a debt based USD stablecoin that can also be used as collateral within the Anchor protocol to achieve high capital efficiency, leverage and native yield."}

Metaforo\u2019s goal is to help Web3 communities to build their online communities and with comprehensive Web3 tools. Metaforo uses NFTs, POAPs (Proof of Attendance Protocol) and the community's choice of tokens to apply permission management. The Metaforo platform also supports airdrops and peer-to-peer tipping without a gas fee. Members of the communities can use their NFTs for the community avatar, and contributors are recognized and compensated with rewards in the process of the user\u2019s daily interaction in the community."}

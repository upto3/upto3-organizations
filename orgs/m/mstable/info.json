The protocol was created to address three major problems: significant fragmentation in same-peg crypto assets, lack of yield in fiat currencies and pegged crypto assets, lack of protection against permanent capital loss in pegged crypto assets. mStable addresses these problems through the creation of meta-assets, which are fully backed by a diversified basket of existing tokenised same-base assets."}

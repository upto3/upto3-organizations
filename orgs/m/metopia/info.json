The reputation system automatically aggregates user profiles from data protocols (RSS3, Ceramic, Moralis, The Graph, etc.). The governance platform allows customizing DAO governance policies based on user contributions and credentials. The reward certification platform allows the community to reward members for their contributions through POAP, SBT, etc. Metopia acts as an infrastructure for creating a user-side reputation system and a governance provider based on user reputation, from membership management to community development, Metopia is creating new community standards for Web3."}

Players can explore the world with different on-chain identities. Creators can enrich and extend the world by building immersive 3D decentralized applications (DApps) that can connect to external services and applications. For example, players can visually trade and purchase NFTs through 3D DApps from OpenSea and other marketplaces. All in-game objects and NFTs have their own lifecycles. Landowners can customize their behaviors, appearances, and transformations via Turing-complete programs."}

MolochDAO invented the \u201cRageQuit\u201d mechanism introduces a time-delay between investment decisions and deployment of funds, within which every member has the option to exit with their propositional share of assets in the treasury before the investment is made. RageQuit provides a completely new assurance to members of an investment collective: A right to exit in an investment context, in case the shared decision does not reflect the individual\u2019s values or goals.

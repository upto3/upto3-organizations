Merlin Protocol implements a lease liquidity pool protocol based on Automated Market Maker, which automatically matches lease orders without middlemen, which solves the problem of insufficient capital utilization in the NFT market and the need of leverage high-quality NFTs. Furthermore, it chooses BTC hash power as the first application, which is a kind of common valuable digital asset. Integrating with NFTs also meets the needs of miners, so that the hash power can be better circulated, and improve the capital utilization in the mining operation."}

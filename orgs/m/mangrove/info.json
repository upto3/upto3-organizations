This new flexibility enables liquidity providers to post offers that are not fully provisioned. The Mangrove's order book lists promises instead of locked commitments. Liquidity can be shared, borrowed, lent and, at the same time, be displayed in the Mangrove's order book, ready to be sourced when, and only when, an offer is hit."}

MAP Protocol is a blockchain interoperable protocol designated for cross-chain Dapps, application-ready, all-chain coverage, cost-efficient, and security-finality. MAP Protocol provides verification finality by Light-client, supports smart contract development on Map Relay Chain, offers cross-chain services components for Dapp's convenient deployment, and enables universal connections with all chains by proactively embedding other chains' feature as pre-compiled contracts in EVM layer of Map Relay Chain."}

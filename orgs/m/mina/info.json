This size should allow anyone to operate a node and help secure its network without needing sophisticated computer hardware.\nThe key to Mina Protocol is the incorporation of zk-SNARKs, which allows users to confirm they have certain data without revealing that data to each other. Mina mainnet was launched on March 23, 2021."}

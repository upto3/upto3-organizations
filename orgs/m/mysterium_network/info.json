The network itself is made up of residential and non-residential IPs as nodes, which are run in homes, offices and cell phones across the globe. Mysterium\u2019s decentralised VPN allows anyone to rent their unused bandwidth and IP address with those in need, protecting others against censorship, surveillance and cybercrime."}

Mero delegates liquidity to where it is the most efficient by deploying novel multi-utility liquidity pools, yield-farming strategies, off-chain bots (keepers), and customizable Actions. Any user can deposit assets into a Mero liquidity pool to earn yield. Furthermore, users can make their liquidity reactive by registering their Mero LP tokens to Actions. Registered LP tokens continue to earn yield and Mero rewards until user-defined conditions are met and liquidity is sent to where it is needed."}

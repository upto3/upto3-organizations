Each Mecha is a collection of NFT representing robot parts. They can be purchased online with the game's crypto-currency called Mechanium, using Ethereum, or by card. These parts once assembled give birth to a controllable robot in a PvP combat video game. The player earns Mechanium by winning battles. He is then able to trade and buy new Mecha parts to become the best MechaChain pilot."}

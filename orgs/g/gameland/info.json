The pipeline + vertical community model can provide players with a one-stop high-quality experience for game communities. It also builds a bridge for developers to connect with high-quality feedback from players, solving the research and development pain points of developers who find it difficult to obtain high-quality feedback from players. Through an open social graph, users can easily manage their social network data and return ownership of social data to users. Gameland was incubator by Chromia."}

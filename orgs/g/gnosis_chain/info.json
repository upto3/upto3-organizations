The chain uses a unique dual-token model; xDai is a stable token used for transactions, payments, and fees, and Proof of Stake protection will be provided by GNO with the consensus-layer Gnosis Beacon Chain.\nIn December 2021, xDai and Gnosis officially merged, and xDai Chain changed its name to Gnosis Chain."}

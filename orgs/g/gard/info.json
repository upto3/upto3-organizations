Users can leverage their assets held in collateralized debt positions to draw a stable line of credit in GARD. To borrow GARD, users must supply collateral in excess of what is borrowed in the form of whitelisted assets such as ALGOs or ALGO derivatives. Once a user holds GARD they may earn interest by staking it, adding to specific liquidity pools, liquidating risky users, selling LP tokens to the protocol, or using GARD to buy other assets to increase leverage."}

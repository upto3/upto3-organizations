When an NFT collection is launched on GumBall Protocol, a corresponding amount of ERC20 tokens (GBTs) are also created for that collection. These tokens are specific to the collection and are sold on a bonding curve, with the liquidity from these sales staying in the bonding curves to act as liquidity for the collection holders to utilize. This allows users to easily swap in and out of GumBall NFT positions instantly, stake their positions, borrow against them, and more."}

GMD employs delta-neutral or pseudo-delta-neutral strategies to aggregate yields from an index pool or an LP to its constituent individual assets, eliminating their risks of impermanent loss or exposure to unwanted assets. GMD\u2019s first products are single-stake (BTC, ETH, USDC) vaults built on top of GMX and GLP. "}

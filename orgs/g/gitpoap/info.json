It bridges the space between existing off-chain contribution platforms such as GitHub and the on-chain world of DAOs & decentralized identity through the representation of meaningful contributions as POAPs. This provides software projects - and eventually many more types of organizations - with a novel way of recognizing & nurturing their communities. At the same time, contributors can showcase this socially-sourced, immutable record of their work, build networks, & develop a Web3 representation of their identity. GitPOAP will use this foundation to power an ecosystem of reputation-based applications."}

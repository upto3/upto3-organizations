GuildFi solves the discovery and access problems for players while enhancing their performance and maximising their rewards. Players\u2019 engagement and achievement are no longer discarded and limited to specific guilds or games, but instead, contribute towards their ranks and elevate their benefits in the long run. Powered by Proof-of-Play, Players can earn GXP from participating in games and quests available on the GuildFi website, which can then be claimed for many benefits from token rewards to an allocation of NFT Metadrop."}

The main objective of the project is to provide simple and comprehensible access to Bitcoin mining for participants of different expertise levels. The project's foundation is its proprietary data centers and a constantly replenished fleet of computing power devices for mining. The GMT Token is a key product of the project and a nexus connecting the professional equipment and the end user. Each token is supported by a portion of the computing power of the GMT device fleet."}

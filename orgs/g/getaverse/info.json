It aims to build a metaverse ecology service platform based on the Web3 digital authentication engine protocol. Getaverse works by providing a window into the WEB3 world on a decentralized identity system, with additional support and rewards for all participants who maintain this window. Any trusted party (verifier) that needs to verify a user will receive the verifiable statement and verify its authenticity."}

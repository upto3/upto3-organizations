Built on open and collaborative infrastructure, Galxe helps Web3 developers and projects leverage credential data to build better products and communities. The protocol allows everyone to create, distribute, and gamify NFTs with the customized on-chain data. Developers can build their own loyalty programs, and individuals can issue and claim the NFTs backed by their on-chain achievements.\nGalxe has amassed one of the largest Web3 credential sets in the world. It now has subgraph queries, on-chain snapshots, governance history, proof of attendance, and a database of interactions with Web2 applications. With Galaxy Credentials, Galxe will be able to build a Web3 DID system that not only gives users a multi-chain identity but also lets others know more about user through past achievements/credentials."}

Each $RENW is underpinned by a renewable energy credit (RECs), which represents a megawatt hour of green electricity generated. Companies and individuals can buy the tokens and apply them toward offsetting their environmental footprints. Upon burning of the $RENW token, buyers are airdropped a verified green NFT receipt called the Eisbaer, that represents their proof-of-impact and gives them the right to participate in their climate change community, which eventually will include DAO governance and new project voting rights."}

With Rigor, lenders find and finance building projects and gain transparency into the flow of their digital dollars, all governed by smart contracts and secured on a blockchain. As construction tasks are completed and verified, Rigor automates payments for those tasks, paying the small businesses responsible for the work immediately and directly. When the home is sold, the lender is repaid a fixed-yield rate, with interest."}

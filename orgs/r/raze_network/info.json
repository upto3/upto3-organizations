It is built as a native privacy layer that can provide end-to-end anonymity for the entire DeFi and Web3.0 stack. The Raze Network applies zkSNARKs to the Zether framework to build a second-layer decentralized anonymous module. The objective of Raze Network is to enable multichain privacy-preserving payment and trading systems, while protecting the transparency of assets and behaviours from surveillance."}

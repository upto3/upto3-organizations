The protocol leverages undercollateralized leverage to enable users to increase their positions in top-tier vaults and strategies, resulting in higher returns for both yield farmers and passive lenders. Rodeo aims to enhance the user experience of core leverage farms by introducing additional development layers such as Automated Vaults, Hedged Solutions, Options Strategies, and more. These tools are designed to optimize yields and mitigate risks for users. "}

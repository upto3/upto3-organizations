The staking rewards of a given tethered actionable NFT are dependant on the in-game performance of that asset; be it a character, vehicle or game builder. As such, players are highly incentivized to participate in gaming and level up their NFT. Liquidity stakers are also incentivized to perform better against their opponents with increased staking multipliers.\nActionable assets in the ecosystem are tethers and representations of an RPG (the native token of Revolve) stake. Simply, these NFTs will need to be returned to the staking contract in order for players to withdraw the corresponding RPG staked. NFT staking contracts can also be bought and sold through the Revolve NFT marketplace. This model ensures that the value of tethered NFTs is always contained within, and supports the value of the native token."}

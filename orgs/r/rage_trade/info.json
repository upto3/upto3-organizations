Its core features are: ETH perp with 10x leverage, omnichain recycled liquidity,  and yield generating 80-20 Vaults. Rage Trade's Delta Neutral Vaults allow users to pool in funds for providing liquidity on GMX in a delta neutral way while earning ETH rewards on GMX. This vault operates on-chain for minimising exposure on ETH and BTC by performing a short on Aave + Uniswap with the help of two separate risk vaults. "}

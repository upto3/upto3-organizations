Each outcome of a real-world event is a unique Non Fungible Token (NFT), and instead of betting on an outcome, you own it (or to be more accurate, you rent it). At the end of the event, the longest owner of each outcome keeps it forever (regardless of whether or not the outcome was correct), it thus becomes a collectable."}

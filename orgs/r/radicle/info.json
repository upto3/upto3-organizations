It enables developers to collaborate on code without relying on trusted intermediaries. Radicle was designed to provide similar functionality to centralized code collaboration platforms \u2014 or \"forges\" \u2014 while retaining Github\u2019s peer-to-peer nature.Instead of user accounts and logins, Radicle uses public key cryptography to identify projects and their collaborators. Instead of issue trackers hosted and owned by a corporation, Radicle uses seed nodes."}

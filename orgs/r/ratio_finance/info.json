This is done by leveraging USDr (Ratio USD), the company's collateralized stablecoin, with the collateralization rates determined by the riskiness of the LP pool. Users will be able to mint USDr by depositing various LP tokens for select Raydium (and other Solana DEX) pools, opening a world of possibilities. Ratio Finance was incubated by Rarestone Capital."}

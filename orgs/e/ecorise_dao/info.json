Built on Solana, the DAO accrues Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) through conservation and sustainable development of land locked as assets in their DAO vault. Ecorise pools land by connecting with landowners who agree to conserve, protect or regenerate their land. Lands are locked in the DAO vault using NFTs and their \u201cNatural Capital\u201d value, including PES, is represented on-chain through ECO token."}

EtherScore certifies on-chain reputations of Ethereum users based on previous actions (transaction history); user\u2019s activity is represented by NFTs reflecting the concept of collectible badges. Anyone can issue badges to identify and target specific users based on one or more minting conditions (ex: \u201chaving done 10 swaps on Uniswap\u201d) with no-code."}

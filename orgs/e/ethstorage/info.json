EthStorage will greatly reduce the storage cost of storing a large amount of data on Ethereum, saving the cost to 1% to 0.1%. The low cost of storing large data by EthStorage can better enable a fully decentralized network in the future. EthStorage is highly integrated with EVM and is compatible with Solidity, Remix, Hardhat, and MetaMask. The team received a research grant from the Ethereum Foundation for data availability research."}

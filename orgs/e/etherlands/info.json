Users can buy chunks of land on the Polygon network and a corresponding ERC-721s (NFTs) token is minted. Whoever holds the token has ownership of the land and controls who can build, mine, and play there. Players can allocate chunks (otherwise known as districts) to towns to create an extensive co-op experience."}

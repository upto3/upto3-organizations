Assets and applications designed on Ethereum are built with self-executing smart contracts that remove the need for a central authority or intermediary.\nThe network is fueled by its native cryptocurrency ether (ETH), which is used to pay transaction fees on the network. With the characteristics of open-source, programmable, private, and censorship resistant, Ethereum forms the backbone of a decentralized internet."}

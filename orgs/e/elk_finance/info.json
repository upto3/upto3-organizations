ElkNet, the powerful cross-chain engine at the heart of the network, allows for secure and efficient transfers of value and information, reducing friction and asset fragmentation between blockchains. Community projects and developers are also able to build dynamic multi-chain applications that leverage ElkNet with features such as proxy tokens and cross-chain messaging."}

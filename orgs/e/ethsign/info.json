EthSign aims to tackle data security issues caused by an over-reliance on centralized providers and build back trust in electronic signature services. With its Web3 technology(decentralized Identity, smart contract platforms and decentralized storage networks), the platform enables users to comment on, edit and access each version of an electronic agreement seamlessly and securely.\nIn November 2022, EthSign launched TokenTable, which is an ownership management platform helping project stakeholders including founders, investors, employees, and contributors manage locked and unvested tokens of their projects or portfolios."}
